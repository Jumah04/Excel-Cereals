# Excel Cereals
 Analyzed cereals dataset from kaggle with Excel
🥣 Cereal Nutrition Data Analysis
This project explores a dataset of breakfast cereals (sourced from Kaggle) to identify the healthiest options based on sugar, calories, sodium, fiber, and protein. While these cereals aren't commonly available in Nigeria, this was a great exercise in real-world data cleaning, normalization, and storytelling.

📈 Objective
To calculate a "health score" for cereals and explore its correlation with product ratings and manufacturers.

🔍 Methodology
- Data Cleaning: Removed null values and verified data types
- Normalization: Standardized variables (Z-score normalization)
- Health Score Calculation: Weighted formula applied to key nutrition features
- Correlation Analysis: Checked relationships between health score, rating, and sugar content
- Manufacturer Comparison: Pivot data by manufacturer to analyze average health scores and ratings

💡 Key Insights:
- Health scores show a clear trend—healthier cereals tend to receive higher ratings
- Among all variables, sugar content had the strongest negative correlation with rating—lower sugar = better rating
- Nabisco ranks highest in average cereal rating and also scores well on health
- Kellogg’s has 6 cereals in the top 20 healthiest, but their average rating is pulled down by the sheer volume of products
